You said you hated the ocean, but you're surfin' now
I said I'd love you for life, but I just sold our house
We were kids at the start, I guess we're grown-ups now, mm
Couldn't ever imagine even havin' doubts
But not everything works out, no
Now I'm out dancin' with strangers
You could be casually datin'
Damn, it's all changin' so fast
Así es la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around and it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Así es la vida, sí
Yeah, that's just life, baby
I was barely standin', but now I'm dancin'
He's all over me (goza)
